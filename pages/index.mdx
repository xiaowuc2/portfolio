I’m an undergraduate(4th year Computer Science) machine learning enthusiast, currently working on research projects pertaining to Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I've experience in both industrial research academic research in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm willing to acquire more advanced knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science.

### Education 

* #### University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata
  * Bachelor of Technology - Computer Science (2019 - 2023) | CGPA 9.49/10
  
### Experience

  * Research Assistant at University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. I'm working on research projects pertaining to Machine Learning and Deep Learning under the supervision of `Professor Sankhadeep Chaterjee`. Mainly we're working on imbalanced datasets with GAN's.

  * I've worked on a startup [@NLP AI Automation Private Ltd.](https://www.nlpaia.com/) as Machine Learning Researcher (Intern) with a team comprises IIT and IIM alumni. I've worked on iris detection and Deep Learning / Computer Vision project.

  * I've foundee a ML project based organization [@qxresearch](https://qxresearch.github.io), where we're working on research projects on Machine Learning with 150+ GitHub developers.
 

* #### Volunteering 
    * Machine Leraning Pie & AI event ambassador of [@deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
    * CX Research Program member [@GitHub](https://github.com)
    * Global AI ambassador [@mozilla](https://community.mozilla.org/en/groups/qx-research) : collaborating with 150+ GitHub developers
