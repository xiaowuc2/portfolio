Machine Learning undergraduate researcher (3rd year), currently working on research projects pertaining to Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I've experience in both industrial research and academic research in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I will be applying for a masters/PhD in Computer Vision/Theoretical AI.

### Education 

* #### University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata
  * Bachelor of Technology - Computer Science (2019 - 2023)
  * CGPA 9.43/10
  * Relevant Coursework : Machine Learning, Deep learning, Data Structures, Algorithm, Mathematics

### Experience

* #### Industrial Research
  * I've joined [@omdena](https://omdena.com) `New York` as Junior ML Engineer. Here I'll be working on `Helping the Energy Industry Achieve Digital Transformation Through AI` project with 50 collaborators to help to automatize site schemas in the energy industry building through Computer Vision.
  
  * I'm working in a startup [@NLP AI Automation Private Ltd.](https://www.nlpaia.com/) as Machine Learning Researcher (Intern) with a team comprises IIT and IIM alumni, with experience of over 20 years. Where're I'm working on iris detection and Deep Learning project.

  * I'm the founder of a ML project based organization [@qxresearch](https://qxresearch.github.io), where we're working on research projects on Deep Learning with 150+ GitHub developers from all over the world.
  
 * #### Academic Research

  - Computer Vision : `OpenCV` `dlib` `MediaPipe` 

### Projects
  - #### Open-Source Projects
  
    - [Matlab for Machine Learning](https://github.com/qxresearchx/matlab-for-machine-leaning) is instroduction to MATLAB for machine learning  and application @qxresearch
    - [10 Lines of Python Code](https://github.com/qxresearch/qxresearch-event-1) could automate boring stuffs and solve real-life problems under 10 lines of code @qxresearch 
    - [DSA @Python|C](https://github.com/UEMK-CS-2019/DSA) A Data Structure course consist of different algorithms in C and Python @uemk-cs-2019
    - [Simple Harmonic Motion, Data Visulization](https://github.com/qxresearch/Simple-Harmonic-Motion) is physics data visualization project using matplotlib @qxresearch
    - [Beizer Desmos Graphing](https://github.com/xiaowuc2/BezierDesmosGraphing) mathematics data visualization project of static picture in desmos graphical calculator
  
  - #### Research Projects 
    - [Emotion Detection](https://github.com/xiaowuc2/Emotion-Checking-ML-Computer-Vision) is made with keras which could predic users emotion based on the content user is watching
    - [Sleep Detection]() Basically the code uses iris and yawn detection with the time internval it detects users tiredness using dlib
  

  
### Publication
  
  - [Can computers think? Imitation of human intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340645375_TITLE_CAN_COMPUTER_THINK_IMITATION_of_HUMAN_INTELLIGENCE) (2020)
  

  
### Talks 

- [10 Lines of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0_0gK_CUpM&list=PLK_zxbpEUfmVPsXnl1wx1s6BD8eBUjuOM) : [Repository](https://github.com/qxresearch/qxresearch-event-1) was part of @qxresearch AI event where I've explained how some of my 10 lines of python codes could automate and can be applied everyday life.
- [Code in Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JpVuQNYoho&list=PLK_zxbpEUfmWO7zL7661s8ck4Ly2m0m-m) : [Repository](https://github.com/xiaowuc2/Code-in-Place-2021-Assignment-Solution) volunteer-led course called Code in Place, hosted by Stanford University.
