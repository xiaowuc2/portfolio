This course seeks to offer students an awareness of the role computing may play in problem solving and to let students, regardless of major, feel justified in their ability to develop simple programs that enable them to accomplish their goals. This course is a combination of two courses, Python and Data Structure and algorithm with python. We'll start with basic python and dive into Data Structure and Algorithm along with solving LeetCode problems. This course focuses on solving your doubts and evoke rational questions. Feel free to shoot me with your all creative questions relevant to this course at the discussion panel [here](https://github.com/xiaowuc2/Computational-Thinking-Python/discussions).


### Prerequisites

1. Focus
2. Mathematical Thinking  
3. GitHub and Google account

### Goals

1. Understand how python works using examples and hands on assignments
2. Understand the use of mathematical concepts on the way
3. Understad how to use python to solve coding problems (interview)
4. Implement algorithms from scratch (Assignments)
5. Work on unique projects (guided)

### What's next after this course ? 

1. I strongly suggest you to work on unique python projects. You can take the help from my [Blog](https://xiaowuc2.vercel.app/posts) and [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/qxresearch/) for unique python projects in the domain of `Computer Science`, `Machine Leraning`, `Arduino`, `Cryptography` and `Mathematics`. 

2. Understad Data structure and Algorithm from scratch(I've never heard of anyone who got job without having any knowledge about data strucutre.). If you still have patience, then choose a perticular domain(eg. data science, machine learning, cryptography, cyber security etc) and work on projects in that perticular domain and try to find an internship.

3. If you've time, enrol to a good Data Structure and Algorithm course as now you've experties in object oriented programming in one language. This is the topic which will actually help you to get a job. I've made a DSA with python course, you can check that out here [Udemy]()
