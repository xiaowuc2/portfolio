title: Can Python Generate Truly Random Numbers?
date: 2022/10/16
description: This question has a simple answer, No. Can we demonstrate it? Yes. To demonstrate how the random numbers are not truly random, I undertook an experiment. The pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), which is a technique for creating data that appears random but is nevertheless repeatable. I also spoke about some well-known PRNG algorithms. Is there any probability of producing really random numbers by accident? Yes.
