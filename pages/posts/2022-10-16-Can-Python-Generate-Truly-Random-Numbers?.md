title: Can Python Generate Truly Rnadom Numbers?
date: 2022/10/16
description: This question has a simple answer, No. Can we demonstrate it? Yes. To demonstrate how the random numbers are not truly random, I undertook an experiment. The pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), which is a technique for creating data that appears random but is nevertheless repeatable. I also spoke about some well-known PRNG algorithms. Is there any probability of producing really random numbers by accident? Yes.

Can Python Generate Truly Rnadom Numbers?

The quick answer to this questios is NO. I've conducted an experiment to prove how the random numbers are not really random. 
These numbers are simply generated with pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), which is a technique for creating data that appears random but is nevertheless repeatable. 
I'll describe how these algorithms work and few other popular PRNG algorithms we can use. I'll share few methods through which we can generate truly random numbers and
check it's randomness.


On another experiment I've conducted Randomness Test [^1] on these numbers. Link to that [work](). 


[^1]: Randomness-Test is a method of evaluating data; it examines the distribution of a collection of data to see whether it can be characterised as random.
